# Wind-Turbine-Failure-Analysis

📊 __Project Name__: Wind Turbine Failure Analysis

# 🌐 About Project:
🚀 __Objective__: The primary objective of this project is to reduce unplanned wind turbine failures by 30%, achieving a $2M annual cost saving. By leveraging data analysis and predictive techniques, the aim is to reduce downtime and mitigate financial losses caused by unexpected failures.

__Business Problem__: Unplanned wind turbine engine failures lead to significant losses and adversely impact electricity generation, causing operational disruptions and financial setbacks.

__Business Success Criteria__: Reduce the unplanned failure of wind turbine by atleast 30%.

__Economic Success Criteria__: Achieve a cost saving of atleast 2 million dollars per year due to reduction of unplanned downtime.

__Business Constraint__: Maximize Power Generation while minimizing failures, the project must ensure maximum power generation efficiency to meet energy demands and financial targets.
